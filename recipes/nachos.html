    <br>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>aluminum foil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>¾ cup water</li>
        <li>1 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning mix</li>
        <li>1 (18 ounce) package restaurant-style tortilla chips</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 (15.5 ounce) can refried beans</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) can pitted black olives, drained and chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup salsa</li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream, or more to taste</li>
        <li>4 green onions, diced</li>
        <li>1 (4 ounce) can sliced jalapeno peppers, drained</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
